## 2026-06-09 — CloudStream Hourly Cron (00:10 BST)

**Session start:** 00:10 BST

### What was done:
- Board was stale — last log entry 2026-06-04 (5 days ago) but the **favourites UI commit (21ab251) was already on `develop`** from 2026-06-08 with green CI. Backfilled into the log.
- Identified that all "Next" tasks (P207 DVR, P208 Monetisation, P205 Firestore) had hard external blockers. Picked a real unblocked follow-on from the CloudStream skill's "What still needs to be built" list: **V01 VOD info panel**.
- V01: VOD info panel — fully implemented and shipped:
  - `vodInfoProvider`: new `FutureProvider.family<XtreamVodInfo, int>` in `app_providers.dart` calling `XtreamApiClient.getVodInfo(vodId)`
  - `VodDetailScreen` refactored from hard-coded "Tap play to start watching" placeholder synopsis to real Xtream metadata:
    - **Cover:** prefers higher-res `XtreamVodInfo.cover` over the lower-res `stream.logo` (Xtream's VOD cover is the same poster as the VOD card but at full resolution)
    - **Metadata row:** real chips — ★ rating (parsed float), ⏱ duration (parsed from `105 min` / `1:45:00` / raw seconds → `1h 45m` / `45m`), 📅 release year (4-digit regex extraction), 👤 director — all only shown when the VOD info call has succeeded
    - **Synopsis:** real plot from `XtreamVodInfo.plot`; loading shimmer (4 grey bars) while fetching; italic "No synopsis available" when plot is empty/null; error fallback "Could not load details — tap play to start watching" so user can still recover and play
    - **Cast block:** appended below synopsis when `info.cast` is non-empty
  - 5 new tests: `XtreamVodInfo.fromJson` (full, name-fallback to top-level, missing info block, seasons+episodes) + `vodInfoProvider` Riverpod injection test
- Pushed `bf59c64` — CI ✅ (5m53s) — Release ✅ (6m25s) — APK rebuilt

### CI status:
- `feat(V01): VOD info panel — real plot, cast, director, rating, duration` ✅ passed CI + Release
- All Phase 2 (P201–P204, P206) + V01 now Done

### What's next:
- Series/episode browsing — `getSeriesInfo()` → `XtreamSeriesInfo` → season/episode hierarchy (unblocked, no external deps)
- **P205**: Profile sync via Firestore (Backlog — needs Firebase credentials)
- **P207**: DVR / recordings (Backlog, revenue-gated after P208)
- **P208**: Monetisation (Backlog — RevenueCat paywall)
- **C06**: Smoke test on Firestick (blocked on josh)

### Backfill — 2026-06-08 (favourites UI, 21ab251):
- 21ab251: `feat(favourites): UI for per-profile favourites + favourites-only filter`
  - `favouritesOnlyProvider` (StateProvider<bool>), `filteredLiveStreamsProvider` extended to intersect with active profile favourites
  - `ChannelTile`: ConsumerWidget, star/star_border IconButton per row that toggles favourite without triggering row's play action
  - `CategoryFilterChips`: new "★ Favourites" chip alongside the existing "All" / category chips. "All" clears both filters.
  - 6 ProfileStore tests + 4 filter tests. **20 tests total** (was 10). Zero new analyze warnings.
  - Pushed to `develop` 2026-06-08T23:12 BST. CI ✅ (5m21s). Release ✅ (6m8s).

## 2026-06-04 — CloudStream Hourly Cron (13:00 BST)

**Session start:** 12:15 BST

### What was done:
- P206: Catch-up TV — fully implemented and shipped:
  - `XtreamEpgEntry.hasCatchup`: parses `has_catchup` bool from Xtream API response
  - `XtreamEpgEntry.isInCatchupWindow`: true if programme ended within last 3 hours
  - `XtreamApiClient.buildCatchupStreamUrl(streamId, startTime)`: public method constructing `/live/{user}/{pass}/{id}.m3u8?start={epoch}`
  - `XtreamEpgEntry.fromJson`: now handles `has_catchup` field (int 1 or bool true)
  - EPG programme blocks: show `Icons.replay` badge for past programmes that are catch-up eligible
  - `_openChannel(stream, programme)`: detects past programme with catchup → calls `_playCatchup()`
  - `_playCatchup()`: builds catchup URL, passes as `PlayerScreen(streamUrl: ...)` override
  - `PlayerScreen`: already supports `streamUrl` override (from VOD work) — no changes needed
  - Refactored: `onProgrammeTap` callback chain through `_ProgrammeRow` → `_EpgGrid` → `_EpgGuideScreenState`
- Pushed `fd29aa2` — CI ✅ Analyze ✅ Test ✅ (10 tests) — Release ✅

### CI status:

## 2026-06-04 — CloudStream Hourly Cron (10:00 BST)

**Session start:** 09:20 BST

### What was done:
- CI was failing on `develop` — P203 commit (26942615661) broke `widget_test.dart`:
  - Root cause: `AuthRouter` watches `sharedPreferencesProvider` which throws `UnimplementedError` when not overridden. `main.dart` correctly overrides it, but the test didn't.
  - Fix: Added `SharedPreferences.setMockInitialValues({})`, `SharedPreferences.getInstance()`, and `sharedPreferencesProvider.overrideWithValue(prefs)` to the test
- Pushed `a235418` — CI ✅ (5m4s)

### CI status:
- `fix(widget_test): mock SharedPreferences to fix sharedPreferencesProvider override error` ✅ passed (5m4s)
- P203: `feat(P203): multi-profile local — ProfileStore, ProfileSwitcherScreen…` ✅ Release passed (6m17s)
- All Phase 2 (P201–P203) now Done

### What's next:
- P204: Search — in-memory index over live + VOD, <300ms on Firestick
- C06: Smoke test on Firestick (blocked on josh)
- B202: Firebase integration (Backlog)

## 2026-06-04 — CloudStream Hourly Cron (07:00 BST)

**Session start:** 06:15 BST

### What was done:
- P202: VOD library + player reuse — fully implemented and shipped:
  - `WatchProgressStore` (`core/storage/watch_progress_store.dart`): SharedPreferences-backed persistence for VOD watch progress, keyed by `profileId + streamId`. Supports save/load/clear/list.
  - `shared_preferences` added to pubspec.yaml
  - `app_providers.dart`: added `sharedPreferencesProvider`, `watchProgressStoreProvider`, `watchProgressProvider` (family over streamId+profileId)
  - `main.dart`: async `main()` with `SharedPreferences.getInstance()` and `ProviderScope` override
  - `PlayerScreen`: added `startPosition` param; added `_onPositionChanged` listener that saves progress every 30s; `_saveProgress()` called on `dispose()`
  - `VodDetailScreen`: new screen between tap and play — shows cover, title, synopsis placeholder, and two buttons: **Resume** (loads saved position) and **Start Over**
  - `vod_screen.dart`: tap VOD card now navigates to `VodDetailScreen` instead of playing directly
  - All analyze errors resolved (zero new errors introduced)
- Pushed `751a3b9` — CI ✅ Analyze ✅ Test ✅

### CI status:
- `feat(P202): VOD library — watch progress store, resume prompt, VOD detail screen` ✅ Release passed (5m36s) ✅ CI passed (5m50s)

## 2026-06-01 — CloudStream development begins

**Session start:** 20:00 BST

### Key decisions made:
- Android first (sideloading on Firestick for rapid iteration)
- FastAPI backend proxy on VPS (avoids CORS, handles stream handoff, caches EPG)
- Clean Architecture in Flutter (data/domain/presentation layers)
- Backend before frontend — get API solid before hooking Flutter to it
- Xtream test fixtures for development, real server pointed in on deploy
- Firebase credentials deferred (env vars at deploy time)
- Backend sessions stored in-memory (upgrade to Redis when scaling)

### Architecture locked:
```
Firestick (Flutter) → FastAPI Proxy (VPS) → Xtream Server (IPTV)
                              ↓
                       EPG Aggregator (XMLTV → SQLite cache)
```

### Environment:
- VPS: ubuntu-16gb-nbg1-1 (100.112.53.35), UK time (Europe/London)
- Repo: github.com/citralia/cloudstream
- Branches: main (protected) + develop (integration)
- CI: GitHub Actions — analyze, test, build iOS/Android/macOS

### What's been done today:
- [x] F09: Settings screen — server URL display, username, version, sign out with confirm dialog, about section, PiP/quick-switch as coming soon
- [x] Fixed CI workflow — was missing `push` trigger, only ran on `pull_request`; now also runs on push to main/develop
- [x] F08: Category filtering — horizontal chip bar above channel list, filters via selectedCategoryProvider
- [x] Fixed pre-existing CI errors: `Icons.guide` → `Icons.menu_book`, removed `const` from `BottomNavigationBar.items`, fixed stale widget test
- [x] Fixed `CategoryListResult.categories` → `result.live`
- [x] CI passes: Analyze ✅ Test ✅ Build macOS ✅ Build iOS ✅

### What's next:
- F10: Android smoke test (side-load on Firestick) — blocked on josh
- Phase 1 features (channel switching < 1s, PiP, gesture controls)
- VPS deployment when josh gets home access (has Xtream server to connect)

---

## Session context

Josh is working from his phone (no VPS/MacBook access). All code committed to GitHub — verifiable, reviewable. CI runs on every push to develop.

When josh gets home:
1. Pull develop branch
2. Deploy backend: `ssh vps && docker run ...` (command ready)
3. Configure env vars (Xtream URL, Firebase credentials)
4. Open Flutter in Android Studio → build once to verify
5. For iOS: pull → Xcode → build → (future) TestFlight
