## 2026-06-01 — CloudStream development begins

**Session start:** 20:00 BST

### Key decisions made:
- Android first (sideloading on Firestick for rapid iteration)
- FastAPI backend proxy on VPS (avoids CORS, handles stream handoff, caches EPG)
- Clean Architecture in Flutter (data/domain/presentation layers)
- Backend before frontend — get API solid before hooking Flutter to it
- Xtream test fixtures for development, real server pointed in on deploy
- Firebase credentials deferred (env vars at deploy time)
- Backend sessions stored in-memory (upgrade to Redis when scaling)

### Architecture locked:
```
Firestick (Flutter) → FastAPI Proxy (VPS) → Xtream Server (IPTV)
                              ↓
                       EPG Aggregator (XMLTV → SQLite cache)
```

### Environment:
- VPS: ubuntu-16gb-nbg1-1 (100.112.53.35), UK time (Europe/London)
- Repo: github.com/citralia/cloudstream
- Branches: main (protected) + develop (integration)
- CI: GitHub Actions — analyze, test, build iOS/Android/macOS

### What's been done today:
- [x] F08: Category filtering — horizontal chip bar above channel list, filters via selectedCategoryProvider
- [x] Fixed pre-existing CI errors: `Icons.guide` → `Icons.menu_book`, removed `const` from `BottomNavigationBar.items`, fixed stale widget test
- [x] Fixed `CategoryListResult.categories` → `result.live`
- [x] CI passes: Analyze ✅ Test ✅ Build macOS ✅ Build iOS ✅

### What's next:
- F09: Settings screen (server URL edit, logout, about)
- VPS deployment when josh gets home access (has Xtream server to connect)
- F10: Android smoke test (side-load on Firestick)

## Session context

Josh is working from his phone (no VPS/MacBook access). All code committed to GitHub — verifiable, reviewable. CI runs on every push to develop.

When josh gets home:
1. Pull develop branch
2. Deploy backend: `ssh vps && docker run ...` (command ready)
3. Configure env vars (Xtream URL, Firebase credentials)
4. Open Flutter in Android Studio → build once to verify
5. For iOS: pull → Xcode → build → (future) TestFlight
