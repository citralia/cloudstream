## 2026-06-02 — CloudStream Hourly Cron (05:15 BST)

**Session start:** 04:05 BST

### What was done:
- CI was failing on `develop` due to `P101: channel switching < 1s` (a7b324e)
  - Root cause: Flutter 3.44 broke `CardTheme` → now requires `CardThemeData`
  - Fix: 1-line change in `app_theme.dart:105` — `CardTheme` → `CardThemeData`
  - Also removed 2 stray doc files accidentally committed earlier
- Pushed fix (513c79c) — CI passed ✅ (5m32s)
- P101 marked Done in board

### CI status:
- `fix(app_theme): CardTheme → CardThemeData for Flutter 3.44 compat` ✅ passed (5m32s)
- Release v0.0.1 ✅ https://github.com/citralia/cloudstream/releases/tag/v0.0.1

### What's next:
- P102: Quick channel switcher overlay
- P103: PiP support
- P104: Gesture controls
- P105: Full EPG guide screen
- C06: Smoke test on Firestick (blocked on josh)

## 2026-06-01 — CloudStream development begins

**Session start:** 20:00 BST

### Key decisions made:
- Android first (sideloading on Firestick for rapid iteration)
- FastAPI backend proxy on VPS (avoids CORS, handles stream handoff, caches EPG)
- Clean Architecture in Flutter (data/domain/presentation layers)
- Backend before frontend — get API solid before hooking Flutter to it
- Xtream test fixtures for development, real server pointed in on deploy
- Firebase credentials deferred (env vars at deploy time)
- Backend sessions stored in-memory (upgrade to Redis when scaling)

### Architecture locked:
```
Firestick (Flutter) → FastAPI Proxy (VPS) → Xtream Server (IPTV)
                              ↓
                       EPG Aggregator (XMLTV → SQLite cache)
```

### Environment:
- VPS: ubuntu-16gb-nbg1-1 (100.112.53.35), UK time (Europe/London)
- Repo: github.com/citralia/cloudstream
- Branches: main (protected) + develop (integration)
- CI: GitHub Actions — analyze, test, build iOS/Android/macOS

### What's been done today:
- [x] F09: Settings screen — server URL display, username, version, sign out with confirm dialog, about section, PiP/quick-switch as coming soon
- [x] Fixed CI workflow — was missing `push` trigger, only ran on `pull_request`; now also runs on push to main/develop
- [x] F08: Category filtering — horizontal chip bar above channel list, filters via selectedCategoryProvider
- [x] Fixed pre-existing CI errors: `Icons.guide` → `Icons.menu_book`, removed `const` from `BottomNavigationBar.items`, fixed stale widget test
- [x] Fixed `CategoryListResult.categories` → `result.live`
- [x] CI passes: Analyze ✅ Test ✅ Build macOS ✅ Build iOS ✅

### What's next:
- F10: Android smoke test (side-load on Firestick) — blocked on josh
- Phase 1 features (channel switching < 1s, PiP, gesture controls)
- VPS deployment when josh gets home access (has Xtream server to connect)

## Session context

Josh is working from his phone (no VPS/MacBook access). All code committed to GitHub — verifiable, reviewable. CI runs on every push to develop.

When josh gets home:
1. Pull develop branch
2. Deploy backend: `ssh vps && docker run ...` (command ready)
3. Configure env vars (Xtream URL, Firebase credentials)
4. Open Flutter in Android Studio → build once to verify
5. For iOS: pull → Xcode → build → (future) TestFlight
